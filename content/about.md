I am Vi, a long-time Linux user and administrator. I started using Linux when I was 13 years old, and I have faced a set of unique challenges due to wanting to always do things "my way" and use obscure software.

As of today, in my personal projects I have reached a balance between having an easy to set-up and reliable way of working while still using the specific software I like.  
I decided to open a blog to share my tips, tricks and findings.
